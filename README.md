- **Outcome**: Load, inspect, clean, and prepare oceanographic datasets.  

### **Module 2: Static Plotting and Initial Visualizations**
- **Focus**: Matplotlib (line, scatter, bar, histograms) & Seaborn (statistical plots).  
- **Outcome**: Create clear and informative 2D plots for oceanographic trends.  

### **Module 3: Geospatial Mapping**
- **Focus**: Cartopy, map projections, overlays of SST, chlorophyll, etc.  
- **Outcome**: Produce professional-quality geospatial maps.  

### **Module 4: Advanced Data Analysis and Specialized Plots**
- **Focus**: Time-series analysis, resampling, anomalies, vertical cross-sections.  
- **Outcome**: Perform temporal and vertical data visualization.  

### **Module 5: Visualizing Vector Fields and Flow**
- **Focus**: Quiver plots, streamlines, and current visualizations on maps.  
- **Outcome**: Visualize and interpret ocean current data.  

### **Module 6: Interactive and 3D Visualizations**
- **Focus**: Plotly for interactive charts, basic 3D plots (e.g., bathymetry).  
- **Outcome**: Create dynamic, engaging, and interactive visualizations.  

### **Module 7: Capstone Project**
- **Focus**: Apply all skills in a **self-selected mini-project**.  
- **Outcome**: A tangible project demonstrating full data-to-visualization workflow.
